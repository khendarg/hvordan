# Documentation for script: _quod.py_

## Summary
This script generates HTML reports with hydropathy plots and representations of TCDB BLAST hits (mostly replicating the [TCDB BLAST tool](http://www.tcdb.org/progs/blast.php)) for _Protocol2_ results. 
This script generates average hydropathy plots with arbitrary resolution in a variety of commonly usef formats. 
This can be done on multiple sequences.
This tool mostly replicates [WHAT](http://biotools.tcdb.org/barwhat2.html).

## Dependencies
The following programs need to be available in your path for this program to run properly:

1. **_Python 2.7+_**  
Visit the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

You can also run the script without arguments (or with -h or --help) to display the options:

    -f force all inputs to be interpreted as filenames (only useful for all-caps filenames with no extension)
    -s force all inputs to be interpreted as sequences
    -v verbose output
    -d directory to store graphs in (recommended only with autogenerated filenames) (default: .)
    -o filename of graph relative to the value of -d (default: (autogenerated))
    -q disables automatic opening of graphs
    -a viewer to be used for opening graphs
    -t file format: {eps, jpeg, jpg, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz, tif, tiff} (default: png)
    -r resolution in dpi (default: 80)
    -l graph title
       (positional) sequences or filenames
