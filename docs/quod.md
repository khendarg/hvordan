# Documentation for script: _quod.py_

## Summary
This script generates HTML reports with hydropathy plots and representations of TCDB BLAST hits (mostly replicating the [TCDB BLAST tool](http://www.tcdb.org/progs/blast.php)) for _Protocol2_ results. 
This script generates average hydropathy plots with arbitrary resolution in a variety of commonly usef formats. 
This can be done on multiple sequences.
This tool mostly replicates [WHAT](http://biotools.tcdb.org/barwhat2.html).

## Warning
This script excludes the N-terminal `window` residues from graphs. Make sure length discrepancies with sequences are less than or equal to `window`

## Dependencies
The following programs need to be available in your path for this program to run properly:

1. **_Python 2.7+_**  
Visit the [official website](https://www.python.org/). 
This program was not tested with more recent versions of Python but was implemented with some forward compatibility.

2. **_Matplotlib 1.5.1-2.0.0+_**  
Visit the [official website](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Command line options
The following options are available. 
You can also run the script without arguments (or with -h or --help) to display the options:

    -f force all inputs to be interpreted as filenames (only useful for all-caps filenames with no extension)
    -s force all inputs to be interpreted as sequences
    -v verbose output
    -d directory to store graphs in (recommended only with autogenerated filenames) (default: .)
    -o filename of graph relative to the value of -d (default: (autogenerated))
    -q disables automatic opening of graphs
    -a viewer to be used for opening graphs
    -t file format: {eps, jpeg, jpg, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz, tif, tiff} (default: png)
    -r resolution in dpi (default: 80)
    -l graph title
       (positional) sequences or filenames
    -m manually add TMSs

##Manual TMS specification

TMS sets for different sequences are specified by space-separated comma-separated ranges. The following example specifies a TMS spanning residues 1-20 for the first/only sequence in seq1.fa:

```
./quod.py seq1.fa -m 1-20
```

This specifies TMSs for different sequences in seqcassete.faa:

```
./quod.py seqcassette.faa -m 1-20,30-50 3-23
```

This specifies TMSs for the second sequence but leaves the first to HMMTOP:

```
./quod.py seq1.fa seq2.fa -m skip 1-20,30-50,60-80
```
